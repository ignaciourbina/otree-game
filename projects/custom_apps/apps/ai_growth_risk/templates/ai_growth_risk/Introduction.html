<p>
    You and another participant oversee when to wind down an advanced AI project. A longer
    deployment delivers more growth tokens but exposes the lab to a higher chance of a
    catastrophic failure that wipes out all gains. Each of you will secretly select one of
    the prepared deployment plans. The group outcome uses the average of your two plans.

            The table below translates each plan into the number of incentive tokens you

            are pre-computed from the theoretical model so that choices aligning with the
            predicted optimum yield the highest payoffs on average.

    The benchmark predicted by the research model keeps the system online for about
    {{ benchmark_runtime|floatformat:1 }} years and awards roughly
    {{ benchmark_tokens|floatformat:1 }} tokens when partners coordinate on that plan.
    You are free to choose any plan in the next screen.

    Your experimental earnings convert directly from tokens using the exchange rate shown
    in the lab instructions. Think carefully about how your choice interacts with your
    partner's decision.
