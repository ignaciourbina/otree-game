<p>
    The environment drawn for this round is <strong>{{ treatment.label }}</strong>.
    In this environment, the shared hazard follows
    \(H(Q) = Q + \tfrac{\kappa}{2}Q^2\) with \(\kappa = {{ treatment.kappa }}\),
    and the weights on the aggregate runtime are \(\omega_1 = {{ treatment.omega.0 }}\),
    \(\omega_2 = {{ treatment.omega.1 }}\).

            Choose the number of years to operate your AI system. Your consumption grows at
            rate \(g_i = {{ treatment.g.0 }}\) if you are Player 1 or \(g_i = {{ treatment.g.1 }}\)
            if you are Player 2 (the lab will tell you your player number on-screen). Survival
            equals \(\exp[-\delta H(Q)]\) with \(\delta = {{ fixed.delta|default:0.01 }}\), so longer
            runtimes for either player raise the shared hazard.
